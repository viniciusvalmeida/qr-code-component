This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) with [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) from the [Frontend-Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/)

## Challenge

The challenge is to build out this QR code component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Outfit, a custom Google Font.
